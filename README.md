## Abstract

Defining important information from biological data is critical for the study of disease diagnosis, drug efficacy and individualized treatment. Hence, the feature selection technique is widely applied. Many feature selection methods measure features based on relevance, redundancy and complementarity. Feature complementarity means that two featuresâ€™ cooperation can provide more information than the simple summation of their indi- vidual information. In this paper implementation, we studied the feature selection technique and proposed a new feature se- lection algorithm based on relevance, redundancy and complementarity (FS-RRC). On selecting the feature subset, FS-RRC not only evaluates the feature relevance with the class label and the redundancy among the features but also evaluates the feature complementarity. If complementary features exist for a selected relevant feature, FS-RRC retains the feature with the largest complementarity to the selected feature subset. To show the performance of FS-RRC, it was compared with several efficient feature selection methods. The experimental results showed the superiority of FS-RRC in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, stability and time complexity. Hence, integrating feature individual discriminative ability, redundancy and complementarity can define more powerful feature subset for biological data analysis, and feature complementarity can help to study the biomedical phenomena more accurately.
